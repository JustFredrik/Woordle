This game was created over a weekend in GameMaker using gml as a side project just for fun. 

Woordle is an Infinite-runner Wordle clone where you can keep playing forever. Each win will add to your streak. Fail to guess the word, and you will lose your streak. 

The game uses a randomly selected word from the most used 5 letter long words in the English language. Woordle will continue to provide you with new words to guess for as long as you wish to play, no more waiting for tomorrow.
